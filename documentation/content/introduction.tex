\chapter{Introduction}

\section{Motivation}
A family member of mine approached me with the request of looking into ways to monitor his beehives. He wanted to collect some basic information about the colony like weight and temperature. This information should be made available over the internet and should be displayed in an easy-to-read format. The goal was to have an overview about the colony and to be able to react to changes in the colony.

After listening to the research of my family member, I decided to look at the solutions that are commercially available. These are quite expensive, proprietary and not open source. Most of them also required a subscription from the manufacturer to work. I decided to look into the possibility of building my own solution. This would allow me to have a solution that is tailored to my needs and is open source.

This project was realized in the context of my Project 2 course at the Berne University of Applied Sciences.

\section{Method}
Given that I was the only one working on this project, I decided to use a simple agile development process. This process did not follow any classical agile methodology, but rather a simplified version of Kanban. The process consisted of me defining a set of tasks that needed to be done. These tasks were then put into a backlog. I then picked a task from the backlog and started working on it. Once the task was completed, I moved onto the next one. This process was repeated until the project was completed.
The tasks were grouped into a set of categories.
