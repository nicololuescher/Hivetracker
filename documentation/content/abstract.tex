\section*{Abstract}

This project provides a guide for building a simple monitoring station for beehives, which allows for the collection of data on the colony, enabling beekeepers to improve management through the monitoring of metrics such as weight and temperature.

The project is location and infrastructure independent. It provides its own power supply and connects to the internet over the GSM network. It is implemented using the ESP32 microcontroller and various "off the shelf" components.

One of the main goals of this project is to make the implementation as simple and cost-effective as possible. The project is designed to be easily extendable and adaptable to the needs of the user.
